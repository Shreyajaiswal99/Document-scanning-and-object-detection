# Document-scanning-and-ocr-detection
In this assignment we used OpenCV to scanned the document and for extracting text from images we used pytesseract.
1) Firstly we import all the required libraries.
2) Read the image and perform edge detection on it.
3) For edge detection we use canny edge detector.
4) Obtain the corner points of the image and remove the backgrround noise form image.
5) Plot the scanned image.
6) After performing scanning on images we extract the text from images.
7) We use pytesseract library for extracting text because it gives highest accuracy.
8) Print the text from images.
